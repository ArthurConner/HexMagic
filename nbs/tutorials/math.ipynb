    "\n",
    "When representing hex directions, we need a coordinate system with several key properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Additive**: Directions should combine naturally (e.g., two \"east\" moves = moving two hexes east)\n",

    "The familiar x,y system works well for horizontal movements, but diagonal vectors involve factors of √3, requiring floating-point arithmetic and introducing potential rounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polar Coordinates\n",
    "Angles are clean multiples of 60°, but constant conversion between polar and Cartesian for rendering makes this impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dive a bit deeper\n",

    "### Disscussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced Topic: Why Roll Uses Negation\n",
    "\n",
    "A common question: why is roll `(-s, -q, -r)` instead of `(s, q, r)`?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: We need `q + r + s = 0` to remain true after rolling.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we tried `roll'(q, r, s) = (s, q, r)`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "s + q + r = -(q + r + s) = -0 = 0  (wait, that works!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, `(s, q, r)` does preserve the constraint! But:\n",
    "```\n",
    "roll'(1, 0, -1) = (-1, 1, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **clockwise** rotation, not counter-clockwise. The conventional choice is:\n",
    "- **Counter-clockwise**: `(-s, -q, -r)`\n",
    "- **Clockwise**: `(-r, -s, -q)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Both preserve the constraint. We choose counter-clockwise to match standard mathematical convention (positive angles rotate counter-clockwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "The negations ensure the **direction** of rotation aligns with our coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison to Modular Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "You mentioned the **modular operator** as a more common way to create cyclic structures. Let's compare:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Modular Arithmetic (ℤ/6ℤ)\n",
    "\n",
    "In **ℤ mod 6**, we have six elements: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations:\n",
    "- **Addition**: `(a + b) mod 6`\n",
    "- **Negation**: `(-a) mod 6 = (6 - a) mod 6`\n",
    "- **Multiplication**: `(a · b) mod 6`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Directions as integers\n",
    "```\n",
    "E = 0, NE = 1, NW = 2, W = 3, SW = 4, SE = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To rotate by 60°: `new_dir = (old_dir + 1) mod 6`  \n",
    "To flip (180°): `new_dir = (old_dir + 3) mod 6`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "- Single number to store per direction\n",
    "- Fast operations with bit masking (`& 0x3F` for mod 64)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**:\n",
    "- **Positions** can't be represented this way! `(0 + 2) mod 6 = 2`, but the position \"2 east\" is different from \"1 east + 1 northeast\"\n",
    "- No natural **distance metric**\n",
    "- No **interpolation** or continuous paths\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cube Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "Positions: `(q, r, s)` with `q + r + s = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations:\n",
    "- **Addition**: Component-wise\n",
    "- **Negation**: Component-wise\n",
    "- **Rotation**: Permutation with sign\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "- Positions AND directions in same framework\n",
    "- Natural distance, interpolation, range queries\n",
    "- Geometric intuition (points in 3D space)\n",
