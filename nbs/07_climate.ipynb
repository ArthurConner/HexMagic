    "## Climate Modeling for Hex Terrain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We built a climate classification system that computes temperature, precipitation, and biome type for each hex in a terrain map. The system uses:\n",
    "- **Latitude** and **elevation** for temperature\n",
    "- **Wind-based moisture flow** for precipitation\n",
    "- **Temperature + precipitation thresholds** for climate classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factors:**\n",
    "1. **Latitude** - Temperature decreases toward poles using cosine scaling\n",
    "2. **Elevation** - Standard lapse rate of ~6.5°C per 1000m\n",
    "3. **Coastal moderation** - Ocean moderates temperature swings (smaller daily range near coast)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key function:** `compute_temperature(lat_range, base_temp_low, base_temp_high, temp_lapse_rate)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Precipitation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:** Wind tree with moisture flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build wind tree** - BFS from coastal (ocean) hexes in the wind direction\n",
    "2. **Flow moisture** - Each hex receives moisture from its upwind parent\n",
    "3. **Orographic effects:**\n",
    "   - Climbing = more rain (orographic lift)\n",
    "   - Descending = rain shadow (less rain)\n",
    "   - Flat = normal decay\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** We run from multiple wind angles (270°, 280°, 260°) and weight-average the results to avoid artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuning parameters:**\n",
    "- `initial_moisture=3000` - Starting moisture at coast (mm)\n",
    "- `travel_decay=0.92` - Moisture retained per hex traveled\n",
    "- `orographic_factor=0.4` - Fraction dropped when climbing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key functions:**\n",
    "- `build_wind_tree(wind_angle)` - Creates parent/child relationships\n",
    "- `compute_precipitation_flow(...)` - Flows moisture through tree\n",
    "- `compute_and_visualize_rainfall(...)` - Multi-angle wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "### Climate Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enum:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Climate(Enum):\n",
    "    MARINE = 0      # Ocean/sea\n",
    "    FRESHWATER = 1  # Lakes/rivers (not yet implemented)\n",
    "    TUNDRA = 2      # Cold (tempHigh < 10°C)\n",
    "    DESERT = 3      # Dry (rain < 150mm)\n",
    "    GRASSLAND = 4   # Moderate (150-600mm rain)\n",
    "    FOREST = 5      # Wet temperate (> 600mm rain)\n",
    "    JUNGLE = 6      # Tropical (> 1500mm or hot+wet)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision order matters:** Marine → Tundra → Desert → Jungle → Forest → Grassland\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- `summarize_climate()` - Prints distribution and stats\n",
    "- `debug_precipitation()` - Shows wind tree and flow stats\n",
    "\n",
    "### Known Issues / Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Freshwater** - Need river tracing to identify lakes/rivers\n",
    "2. **Pre-loaded data** - Files may have old rainfall; use `force_recompute=True`\n",
    "3. **California specifics** - Thresholds tuned for Mediterranean climate; other regions may need adjustment\n",
    "4. **Seasonality** - Current model is annual average; could add wet/dry seasons\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Start\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "demo = TerraDemo()\n",
    "terrain = demo.california()\n",
    "terrain.compute_and_visualize_rainfall(initial_moisture=3000, travel_decay=0.92)\n",

    "## Central Valley River Generation - Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "We built a rainfall-based river generation system that creates rivers flowing from the Sierra Nevada mountains through the Central Valley to the ocean. Rivers start at high-elevation sources with sufficient rainfall and flow downhill following terrain gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**`generate_central_valley_rivers(min_rainfall=400, min_elevation=800, valley_floor=20)`**\n",
    "- Finds river sources in Sierra Nevada (high elevation + rainfall)\n",
    "- Creates rivers from each source using `create_valley_river()`\n",
    "- Merges intersecting rivers with `River.combine_rivers()`\n",
    "- Sorts by accumulated rainfall (proxy for river importance)\n",
    "- Returns list of `River` objects\n",
    "\n",
    "**`create_valley_river(source_hex, valley_floor=20)`**\n",
    "- Traces path downhill from source using `lowest_neighbor()`\n",
    "- Accumulates rainfall along path (used for ranking)\n",
    "- Stops at ocean (elevation < 1) or when stuck\n",
    "- Tracks visited hexes to prevent loops\n",
    "- Returns `River` with path stored in tree structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "| Parameter | Default | Purpose |\n",
    "|-----------|---------|---------|\n",
    "| `min_rainfall` | 400mm | Minimum rainfall at source |\n",
    "| `min_elevation` | 800m | Minimum elevation for sources |\n",
    "| `valley_floor` | 20m | Threshold for valley continuation |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization\n",
    "- Top rivers styled by importance (thicker = more accumulated rainfall)\n",
    "- `river0`: Sacramento/San Joaquin (stroke-width 8, dark blue)\n",
    "- `river1`: Major tributaries (stroke-width 5)\n",
    "- `river2`: Minor tributaries (stroke-width 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Known Issues to Address\n",
    "- Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers not appearing as expected\n",
    "- Rivers stopping too early (may need lower `valley_floor` or different stop conditions)\n",
    "- May need to add explicit drainage basin logic to ensure rivers converge properly in valley\n",
    "- Consider adding flow accumulation algorithm for more realistic river networks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Improvements\n",
    "1. **Flow accumulation**: Sum upstream contributing area rather than just rainfall\n",
    "2. **Explicit outlets**: Define San Francisco Bay area as the target for valley rivers\n",
    "3. **Valley routing**: Special handling for flat valley floor where gradient-following fails\n",
    "4. **River merging**: Better confluence detection where tributaries join main rivers"

We would give general locations  like tropics, mediterrian. artic circle and we would get a startic point and also paremeters to put into the model like the ones for california and maui.\n",
